This documentation covers the core CxD Protocol v2.0, implemented in high-performance C99. The system is architected to prioritize security-at-entry, mass-scalability, and citizen-privacy.

CxD Protocol Architecture
The backend is comprised of three primary modules designed to work in a linear, secure pipeline. Each module follows a strict .h (header) and .c (implementation) pattern.

1. Vetting Gate (vetting_gate.h/c)

Purpose: Prevents "Dishonest Developer" attacks and referendum spam through economic exhaustion.

Gold-Equivalent Stake: Utilizes an off-chain Oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to determine the current value of 1 troy ounce of gold.

Economic Barrier: Requires a stake that is expensive for an individual attacker but accessible to community-backed groups.

The Slash Mechanic: If the Security Council or a vast majority of the community flags a proposal as malicious, the gold-equivalent stake is permanently burned, removing those tokens from the supply.

2. Recursive SNARK Batcher (recursive_snark.h/c)

Purpose: Achieves O(1) verification time for 1,000,000 users.

Merkle-Tree Aggregation: Instead of verifying 1M individual signatures, the system builds a binary tree of Zero-Knowledge proofs.

Compression Ratio: Reduces 1,000,000 proofs into a single Master Proof (≈256 bytes).

Latency Optimization: Reduces chain-level verification time from several seconds to sub-0.1s.

3. UBI Distribution Engine (ubi_distribution.h/c)

Purpose: Ensures fair, anonymous, and singular daily claims.

The Nullifier Protocol: Uses a cryptographic "one-way" value based on the user's secret key and the current day (Epoch).

Anti-Double-Dipping: If a user tries to claim twice, the system identifies the duplicate Nullifier and rejects the claim without ever knowing who the user is.

Treasury Integrity: Maintains a global state to prevent over-distribution.

Technical Specifications & Compilation
Data Types & Constraints

Proof Size: 256 bytes (standard for Groth16/PlonK circuits).

Identity: 32-byte hashed biometric hardware attestation.

Epoch Length: 86,400 seconds (default 24-hour cycle).

Compilation Guide

To compile the core modules for testing on a local Linux/Unix environment:

Bash
# Compile the individual modules
gcc -c vetting_gate.c recursive_snark.c ubi_distribution.c

# Link into a testable binary
gcc vetting_gate.o recursive_snark.o ubi_distribution.o main.c -o cxd_core

# Run the protocol simulation
./cxd_core
Security Invariants
Receipt-Freeness: Users cannot prove how they voted to third parties (prevents bribery).

Hardware Binding: Identity is tied to the physical Secure Enclave of the mobile device (prevents cloud-based botnets).

Auditability: While the voters are anonymous, the tally and the logic are 100% public and auditable via the blockchain.
